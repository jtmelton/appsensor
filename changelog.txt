Changes in version 2.2 (2015/09/18)
--------------------------------------
* First version of appsensor-ui 
  
* Improved query performance of JPA *Store implementations

* Minor refactoring of ResponseStore implementation for code de-duplication

Changes in version 2.1 (2015/06/09)
--------------------------------------
* Geolocation of end users now possible (optional configuration)
  
* Added support for RabbitMQ execution mode

* Added support for Kafka execution mode

* Added support for JMX Notification emitter

* Added support for CEF (over syslog) emitter

* Documentation updates to cover new features 
  and generally enhance end/user developer documentation
  
* Update maven configurations to upgrade dependency
  versions and correct configuration for generating 
  javadocs and maven "site"
  
* Added spring security integration that covers: 
	- events emitted by spring security added to appsensor
	- a custom appsensor user manager
	- a custom appsensor security context repository

* Added example app to show usage in local mode with 
  spring security integration

* Added example app to show the use of appsensor for 
  something other than application layer IDS. In this case, 
  it is being used as an exception tracker. As exceptions 
  are generated, they are logged with appsensor, then a simple
  custom UI shows them in a grouped list. While the example 
  is simple and contrived, a more sophisticated UI could 
  allow for grouping, searching, sorting and analysis.

Changes in version 2.0.1 (2015/02/26)
--------------------------------------
* Support multiple detection point configurations per detection 
  point label (https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues/18)

Changes in version 2.0 (2015/01/27)
--------------------------------------
* AppSensor has gone through a complete re-write, 
  and the current feature set is listed below.
  
* Client-server architecture supporting multiple 
  execution "modes" including: 
	- REST 
	- SOAP
	- Thrift
	- local (shared JVM, java-only)
  
* Any language can be used on the client application. 
  The only requirement is that the language selected 
  must support the communication protocol of the execution
  mode that is configured (ie. if using REST as the 
  execution mode, the language must be capable of making 
  HTTP requests.) 
  The server-side components are Java, but this places
  no restriction on the client applications themselves.

* There is no longer a dependency on ESAPI. AppSensor
  is a standalone project, though it can be used to 
  integrate with projects that also use ESAPI if 
  desired.
  
* The major subsystems are all modular and extensible, 
  including: 
  	- access control
  	- analysis engine
  	- configuration
  	- reporting
  	- storage

* While extensible, all major subsystems have at least
  one reference implementation.

* The core components of the system have been renamed 
  and now follow the appsensor v2 book naming conventions, 
  which is based on standard IDS terminology for clarity.

* Basic user correlation is supported so that client 
  applications that share a user base can share attack information.
  
* A website for the project has been built (appsensor.org).

Changes in version 0.1.x (Legacy)
--------------------------------------
* changelog not maintained
