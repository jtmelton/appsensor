AppSensor is a framework that provides real-time event detection and response. The initial goal is to provide application layer intrusion detection (self-defending applications), though many types of systems are possible using the framework. 

AppSensor has a [website](http://appsensor.org) with further documentation and is an [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor) project.

Previous releases are tracked here in the [releases](https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases). The upcoming releases and milestones are tracked in the [roadmap](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved).

The AppSensor source code is released under an MIT license. See the accompanying LICENSE.txt file for license content.
